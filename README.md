Project: Bicycle Maintenance Time Analysis and Visualization

This project aims to analyze bike rental data collected in 2018 to determine the optimal times for maintenance teams to repair bikes. The analysis focuses on identifying times with lower traffic and fewer bike rentals, ensuring maintenance works are performed efficiently while still adhering to standard working hours (from 8 AM to 5 PM).

Objectives:

Analyze 2018 data to determine the best times for bike maintenance.

Identify time slots with low traffic and the fewest bike rentals.

Create an interactive Tableau report to visually present these times.

Use orange gradients in the visualization to reflect the companyâ€™s branding, as requested by the manager.

Ensure that the visualization is accessible and ethically designed.
